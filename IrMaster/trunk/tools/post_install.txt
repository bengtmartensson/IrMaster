The GUI program can now be started by selecting it from the start
menu, or by double clicking the icon.

Provided you have selected the "Add installation directory to path",
the command line program IrpMaster can be started from a so-called
DOS-box using the command name "irpmaster". (Otherwise the full path
name will have to be used.)
