    wave?
    iec learned?

################ Possible Projects #################

* Interactive calculator for RemoteMaster's/protocols.ini functions, in particular EFC.

* Configurable launcher for other programs -- probably REJECT
    Java programs like RM can be invoked within the same VM.

* Integrate Irscope functionality???
    * hardest is the low level interface, but since FTDI-based, should be do-able, possibly with a dll/so like jp12serial.

* IrpLab: Let the user enter IPRs interactively, parse and present parser errrors as user friendly as possible
    display parse diagrams through dot.
    interactive IRP-expression calculator, including graphical representation of name engine.

* IRDiff: Intelligent diff-er between ir signals, either in pronto format or raw.

* Internationalization? Personally, I could not care less. If someone is volunteering, not to "translate to xxx", but to maintain a translation to xxx...
