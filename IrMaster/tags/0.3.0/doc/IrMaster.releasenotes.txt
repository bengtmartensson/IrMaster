Release notes for IrMaster 0.3.0.

Renamed this document to IrMaster.releasenotes.txt

Use nice icons from the crystal project. (Licensed under LGPL.)

There is now a shortcut menu, allowing shortcuts not only from that
menu, but also, using accelerators from the F-Keys on the keyboard.

Now there is an IrMaster icon. This is associated with the top Frame,
and also installed 
as Windows icon in the setup program. The plotter also sets its
(unzoomed) content as its icon. 

New menu Tools. Update check moved from Help menu to this.

The "war dialer" has been finished. That is, the pause button works,
can also resume. The "current F" can be changed while paused. The Note
button allows for entering notes to last F sent. The accumulated notes
are saved through the Save button, and cleared by the Clear button.

The IrCalc pand has now been removed. The code has been moved to a
separate project. Instead it is now a separate 
project/namespace, org.harctoolbox.IrCalc. It can be accesses through
the new Tools menu.

There is a command-line only option --easy, that severely limits the
elements presented to the user. Removes as much as possible of what
can be confusing for the unexperienced. Aimed at the beginning user; inspired
by a private conversation with Rob Crowe. The windows installer
installs a separate icon, invoking the program with that option. 

Most panes now have a help for the pane, causing a pop-up window (or
the console) to show a 10-100 lines of help for that pane. Can alternatively be
output to the console.

The IR Protocols pane has a "Docu" button that pops up a help on
selected protocol, and its IRP definition (if IrpMaster is selected as
renderer, otherwise the irp file is shown).

On the IR Protocols pane, the D, S, F, T, "Additional parameters" are
made insensitive whenever not part of the currently selected protocol.

There is now an option "use pop-ups for errors etc." that makes errors,
warnings, info appear as pop-ups if selected, as many conventional GUI
programs. If not selected, these are messages are still output to the
console, as before.

UEI learned format is now accepted instead of ccf input -- both
IrpMaster CLI and IrMaster CCF window. New option -u|--uei in
IrpMaster to generate UEI learned format as output.

EFC computations from the IrCalc pane has been removed -- it did not
fit in, and the EFC5 stuff was probably wrong.

Look and feel settings are now in a Options pull-right menu, have been
removed from the Options pane.

Support for exporting UEI learned format in xml and text exports.

Now using the "HarcHardware 0.8.0" library instead of Harctoolbox
0.7.0. This contains a lot of, mostly internal, improvements, but is
not documented yet. Probably not really visible for the user of
IrMaster. GlobalCache is now queried directly on startup.

Using 0.2.1 of IrpMaster, with its improvements, see its release notes.

Using fixed version of PlPlot, so the scaling is output in
"engineering units", e.g. 10^3n, for some n.

Misc. minor bugfixes, layout fixes, documentation fixes, etc.
================================================================
Releasenotes for IrMaster 0.2.0 and IrpMaster 0.2.0

User visible changes:

Plotting implemented using PtPlot.

Wave export and Audio Hardware output device implemented.
New export format Lintronic. 

Wave import.

Many fixes to appearance, more careful layout etc. The main window now
rescales sensibly, making it possible to enlarge CCF window and/or the
log window. The divider on top of the log window allows for resizing
log window.

Have the send-button enabled some more, thus restoring old
short-circuiting behavior (render and sending if text area empty)

The short pronto forms 5000, 5001, 6000, 900a are now recognized in
the CCF window. They can be Plotted (and Analyzed!) directly.

IrpMaster: --analyzeIR --ccf .... was not working; fixed.

war dialer now has #-sends options.

IrProtocols.ini: MCE: make the T toggle. rs200 and intertechno new
protocols. A few toggling protocol (like rc6 and rc5x) was erroneously
written like (...,T=1-T)+, changed to ((...)+,T=1-T).

Internal improvements:

Many internal improvements in API and its documentation.

made exit codes uniform, see IrpUtils

Use jcommander for the decoding of command line decoding of the main
class of class Wave.

Macro new class, presently not really used yet. ModulatedIrSequence
new, use that in the API when appropriate.  append(double) and
parseMacro new. use IrSignal(protocolIni, arg_i, args) in
main. Improved API: use doubles for data (in microseconds, not
periods) and for modulation frequency.

Version info moved into class Version (both IrMaster and IrpMaster).

use odd/even index in IrSequences instead of sign. Improved Help
message in Plotter. Put Time in Plotter header.	Implemented plotting
