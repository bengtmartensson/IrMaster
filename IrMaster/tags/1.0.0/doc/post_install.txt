The GUI program can now be started by selecting it from the start
menu, or by double clicking the icon.

There has been two versions installed: The "easy" version is
optimized for the beginning user, and shows only a very limited number
of options. Also the "full" (non-easy) version initially hides a number of
options, which the user -- if desired -- can turn on from the menu
Options -> Enable Components.

Provided the option "Add installation directory to path" has been selected,
the command line program IrpMaster can be started from a so-called
DOS-box using the command name "irpmaster". (Otherwise the full path
name will have to be used.)
