IrMaster can now be started by selecting it from the start
menu, or by double clicking the icon.

There has been two versions installed: The "easy" version is
optimized for the beginning user, and shows only a very limited number
of options. Also the "full" (non-easy) version initially hides a number of
options, which the user -- if desired -- can turn on from the menu
Options -> Enable Components.

Documentation is available through the Help menu, entry
Content. Please address feedback, bugreports, suggestions etc to the
