* Remove the silly disabling of the Render-button DONE

* Importing ict files with more than one signal: Not clear what the right answer is.

* Implement LIRC support DONE
    * Sending to possibly modified lirc server DONE
    * Sending stop command. DONE
    * Implementing export in LIRC format (can be implemented independently) DONE

* Replace (or complement) view  IrpProtocols by edit -- DONE
* View export directory -- DONE

* Improve Windows integration -- priority LOW
    * Edit IrpProtocols can be implemented without $EDITOR -- DONE
    * View MakeHex folder by firing up explorer, -- DONE
    * Setup.exe (Inno installer)                 -- DONE

* Retain protocol name (if possible) when switching between IrpMaster and Makehex. DONE

* Making GUI sensibly resizable -- Priority LOW (not really needed)
    * CCF-window resizeable
    * Log-window resizeable

* Expose err_limit of the analyzer to the user? Basis? -- Priority LOW (or reject?)

* Implement War dialer note taking facility -- priority LOW

* Implement Pause in war dialer -- priority MEDIUM.
    * Possibility to change Current F in paused mode.

* Implement Plot of CCF-signals -- priority NICE2HAVE.

* Should there be a possibility to shortcut renderer -> decodeIR/AnalyzeIR without going through CCF window? REJECT

* Implement more export formats?
    wave?
    iec learned?
    ??

* Distribute just the ANTLR runtime classes, not the whole antlr-3.4-complete.jar. (Very low priority).

* Updatechecker -- DONE

################ Possible Projects #################

* Interactive calculator for RemoteMaster's/protocols.ini functions, in particular EFC. EFC DONE.

* Configurable launcher for other programs -- probably REJECT
    Java programs like RM can be invoked within the same VM.

* Integrate Irscope functionality???
    * hardest is the low level interface, but since FTDT-based, should be do-able, possibly with a dll/so like jp12serial.

* IrpLab: Let the user enter IPRs interactively, parse and present parser errrors as user friendly as possible
    display parse diagrams through dot.
    interactive IRP-expression calculator, including graphical representation of name engine.

* IRDiff: Intelligent diff-er between ir signals, either in pronto format or raw.

* Internationalization? Personally, I could not care less. If someone is volunteering, not to "translate to xxx", but to maintain a translation to xxx...
